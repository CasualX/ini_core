Compatible with `no_std`.

This library implements a pretty bare-bones, but super fast, streaming INI parser.

Examples
--------

```rust
use ini_core as ini;

let document = "\
[SECTION]
;this is a comment
Key=Value";

let elements = [
	ini::Item::SectionEnd,
	ini::Item::Section("SECTION"),
	ini::Item::Comment("this is a comment"),
	ini::Item::Property("Key", Some("Value")),
	ini::Item::SectionEnd,
];

for (index, item) in ini::Parser::new(document).enumerate() {
	assert_eq!(item, elements[index]);
}
```

The `SectionEnd` pseudo element is returned before a new section and at the end of the document.
This helps processing sections after their properties finished parsing.

The parser is very much line-based, it will continue no matter what and return nonsense as an item:

```rust
use ini_core as ini;

let document = "\
[SECTION
nonsense";

let elements = [
	ini::Item::SectionEnd,
	ini::Item::Error("[SECTION"),
	ini::Item::Property("nonsense", None),
	ini::Item::SectionEnd,
];

for (index, item) in ini::Parser::new(document).enumerate() {
	assert_eq!(item, elements[index]);
}
```

Lines starting with `[` but contain either no closing `]` or a closing `]` not followed by a newline are returned as `Item::Error`.
Lines missing a `=` are returned as `Item::Property` with `None` value.

Format
------

INI is not a well specified format, this parser tries to make as little assumptions as possible but it does make decisions.

* Newline is either `"\r\n"`, `"\n"` or `"\r"`. It can be mixed in a single document but this is not recommended.
* Section header is `"[" section "]" newline`. `section` can be anything except contain newlines.
* Property is `key "=" value newline`. `key` and `value` can be anything except contain newlines.
* Comment is `";" comment newline` and Blank is just `newline`. The comment character can be customized.

Note that padding whitespace is not trimmed by default:
Section `[ SECTION ]`'s name is `<space>SECTION<space>`.
Property `KEY = VALUE` has key `KEY<space>` and value `<space>VALUE`.
Comment `; comment`'s comment is `<space>comment`.

No further processing of the input is done, eg. if escape sequences are necessary they must be processed by the user.

Performance
-----------

Tested against the other INI parsers available on crates.io. Fair warning all parsers except `light_ini` use a document model which allocate using `HashMap` and `String` which isn't exactly fair... In any case `ini_core` still mops the floor with `light_ini` which is a callback-based streaming parser.

These tests were run with `-C target-cpu=native` on an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X.
